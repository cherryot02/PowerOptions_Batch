# Power Options Adjustments ðŸ”‹
The main purpose of this simple project was to streamline the process of adjusting the power options in the Control Panel. <br><br>
The company I worked at had me deploy multiple computers and I had to manually adjust the power options everytime. <br>
I am also aware that there's an executable file called NoSleep somewhere in the internet but just for learning purposes, I made a batch file instead and see if it works. (It does).

## Plan
Depending on the PC, PC brand and whatever your organization has, you might have 2 or more options for power schemes. <br>
In my case there's two, one for balance and one for recommended.<br><br>

1. For the purpose of learning, I want to switch to other option from balanced to recommended.
2. When I press the power button: On battery - shut down, Plugged in - shutdown
3. When I close the lid: On battery - Do nothing, Plugged in - Do nothing
4. Turn off display: On battery - 30 minutes, plugged in - 1 hour
5. Sleep after: On battery - Never, Plugged in - Never
